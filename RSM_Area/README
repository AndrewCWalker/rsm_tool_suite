*********** Summary **********

The RSM_Area code is designed to create a projected area look-up table for use in RSM_Cd which calculates a satellite drag coefficient (and ballistic coefficient) based on a Response Surface Model (RSM) trained from Test Particle Monte Carlo (TPMC) simulations.

RSM_Area is sub-divided into three sections: The "Area_Code" folder, the "RSM_Area_Files" folder, and the master "compute_area.py" python script.


********** Area_Code Folder **********

The Area_Code folder contains the C code (area.c & area.h) that is called by "compute_area.py" to create the projected area look-up table.  This code needs to be compiled by typing "make" in this folder.

The folder also contains the Makefile to compile the area.c code and the area.ensemble file. The area.ensemble file contains theta (yaw) and phi (pitch) angles in radians that are used to create the look-up table. The area.ensemble file is generated by the "compute_area.py" python script based on the user's input parameters. 

The velocity (Umag) is simply an arbitrary dummy variable passed to area.c in order to specific a vector. The default value is 7500 m/s; however, any positive value will work.

The Area_Code folder also contains the "Mesh_Files" folder where the STL mesh files are located. If a new area look-up table is generated, the STL mesh file for that satellite must be located in the "Mesh_Files" folder.


********** RSM_Area_Files **********

The final product projected area look-up tables are located in the RSM_Area_Files folder. These files give the projected area as a function of the pitch and yaw angles. When the code is run with "compute_area.py", the final projected area look-up table file is put in the parent folder (RSM_Area) by default.


********** compute_area.py **********

The compute_area.py script is a the master script that setups the area.ensemble file (to be read in by area.c) and also runs the compiled "area" program. The "area" program is parallel and the number of processors used is set in the "main" function in the compute_area.py script (NPROCS). 


********** How to Run the Code **********

To create a projected-area look-up table for a satellite:

1) Go to the Area_Code folder ("cd Area_Code") and compile the code ("make"). Once the code is compiled, return to the parent folder ("cd ..").

2) Open computer_area.py and modify the input variables near the bottom of the file. These include the mesh filename, the satellite name (used for output naming), the number of processors to use for parallel computation, the pitch and yaw angle resolution, and the minimum and maximum pitch and yaw angles. When finished modifying the input variables, save the file.

3) In the parent folder (RSM_Area), type "python compute_area.py".

4) When the code is finished, a file named {SATNAME}_area.dat will be created in the parent folder (RSM_Area). This contains the projected area look-up table as a function of the pitch and yaw angles.
